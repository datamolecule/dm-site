# School Class List Solution – My Class List helps families connect while minding privacy

Are you still sharing contact lists by hand?

## For parents with pre-school and elementary school age children, which of these scenarios sound most familiar?

1. Your child just got back from school, and tells you about this new friend they made, asking if they can get together to play next weekend. The problem is you don’t know who is this new friend and don’t have the contact details of his or her parents or guardians.

2. Summer camps are over now and your child keeps “reminding” you about this great friend they met last summer who’s from another part of town and goes to a different school. You were supposed to catch up with their parents at pickup time to ask for their email because your kids had such a great time together but life happened and now camps are over and they will never ever be able to play together again for the rest of their life.

3. You are almost done with the surprise birthday party invitations but you can’t seem to find Bob’s dad’s email address. The one you have from the time he invited your child to Bob’s birthday party is bouncing, he pick’s up Bob on a different schedule than yours and the friends you checked with don’t have it either. You now consider making up a story to send a secret message over to him via two first graders.

4. An enthusiastic parent at school takes it upon him or herself to gather the email address and phone number of all parents in their kid’s class. On the spot, without much of an afterthought, you hand them your business card and soon after receive a first list email with 53 other emails in CC with a link to a public online spreadsheet. Several storms of “TAKE ME OFF THIS LIST” reply-all emails soon follow; you are now registered to half a dozen mailing lists and are getting solicitation calls from private tutors who know your child’s name at work.

## There must be a better way

My Class List is a self-service contact list management tool for parents with kids in elementary school, daycare, summer camps, sports club, etc. All situations where children start to make friends whose parents are outside their family’s existing circle of acquaintance.

It’s also a neat alternative to the time consuming and error prone process of asking parents to fill sign-up sheets by hand, having an already busy volunteer manually transcribe all this information into spreadsheets, and sending updates to all school class list members every time an update is required.

**My Class List is built with privacy in mind, let’s parents opt-in, and only share as much contact information as they are comfortable with. It also saves countless hours for volunteers who used to maintain a school class list by hand in the past!**

For parent associations, offering a school class list to your members is a valuable community service. For school and program administrators, it takes the overhead and thorny privacy issue out of providing contact lists to the families you serve.
